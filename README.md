# The program is divided into two parts :
* ## Part A :  Logistic Regression model using gradient descent to predict whether patient have heart disease or not (target) based on 4 predictors (trestbps, chol,thalach, oldpeak)
* ## Part B : SVM model to predict whether patient have heart disease or not (target).
    ### Part B is divided into several parts : 
     *  Read Data.
     *  Data Normalization.
     *  Separate the data into training and testing. 
     *  Convert from data frames to numpy matrices.
     *  Divide the data into patient and healthy.
     *  Plot the data.
     *  Draw error graph between iteration and cost.  
* ## Heart_dataset_description : contain the description of fields in heart dataset .
